Hi, Iâ€™m Anderson ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Causal Inference Practitioner

I'm a data scientist and engineer focused on building robust, production-grade ML pipelines, architecting scalable DevOps workflows, and solving high-stakes problems using causal inference. My work spans experimentation platforms, predictive modeling, infrastructure automation, and analytics-driven product strategy.

 ## Core Areas of Expertise


**Machine Learning Engineering** Building modular, reproducible ML pipelines with integrated tracking (MLflow), monitoring (CloudWatch), and deployment (AWS SAM, Docker, Prefect).

**Causal Inference & Experimentation**
Designing and analyzing A/B tests, quasi-experiments (DiD, RDD), uplift modeling, and measurement systems for marketing, product, and operational decisions.

**DevOps & MLOps**
Automating infrastructure for data science workflows using GitHub Actions, IaC (SAM/CloudFormation), S3 for model artifact storage, and containerized microservices.

**Analytics & Decision Science**
Deep dives into customer behavior, pricing strategies, and operational KPIs using advanced statistics, regression modeling, and Bayesian methods.

## Projects

**Causal Experimentation Toolkit**
Reusable framework for designing, running, and evaluating controlled and observational experiments with diagnostics, power analysis, and effect estimation.

**Infra Scripts & Tooling**
Scripts, SAM templates, and container setups for rapid provisioning of dev/test environments for ML workflowsâ€”integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Current Focus

- Fine-tuning and scaling ML pipelines for real-time inference
- Building modular, interpretable causal inference tools
- Experimentation strategy for product and growth teams
- MLOps best practices with emphasis on cost monitoring and observability
